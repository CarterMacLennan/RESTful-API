A simple RESTful API to better understand REST's architectural style for designing APIs.

* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - An ODM used to provide structure to the data I wished to store in MongoDB
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) - Used as a runtime environment for JS & install third-party packages with npm
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Used to perform a series of middleware function calls, and run the node server 
* [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - Used as our server's view engine

### TOOLS
- [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) - GUI for mongoDB, helped with testing
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - Used for testing requests againts our API server
